# Level Numbering

**Level Numbering** allows users to organize levels with separate naming rules for ground and basement levels. By defining a clear distinction between above-ground and below-ground(basement) levels, the add-in ensures consistent level naming across projects.

## Features

* **Automatic Naming for Levels:** \
  Define unique naming rules for basement and ground levels.
* **Ground Level Reference:** \
  Use the ground level as the reference point for naming levels above and below.
* **Preview and Edit:** \
  Review the new names and adjust them before finalizing.

## Notes

* The identifier can be up to 6 characters long.
* It can include numbers (1-999999) or letters (a-zzzzzz, A-ZZZZZZ).
* Mixing numbers and letters is not allowed.
