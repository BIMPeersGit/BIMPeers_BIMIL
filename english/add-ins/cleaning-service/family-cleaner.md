## 📌 **What is Family Cleaner?**

Family Cleaner is a Revit Add-in that permanently deletes selected families from the **Project Browser**.\
Unlike the standard Delete command which removes only from the view, Family Cleaner removes both family instances and definitions, delivering a **Shift+Delete-like effect**.
