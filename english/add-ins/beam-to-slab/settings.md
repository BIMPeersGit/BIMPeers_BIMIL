# Settings

Customize the beam attachment parameters to achieve optimal alignment with upper slabs.



## Reference Plane

Specify the face of the slab to which beams will attach:

## Detail

### Offset Limit

Define the detection range within which the beam identifies the slab.

This value is measured from the centerline of the beam, specifying how high above the beam it will search for a slab to attach.



### Orientation for Sloping Slab

Select the alignment mode for beams attached to sloping slabs:

* **Normal**: Aligns beams perpendicularly to the slab slope, adapting to the angle of the slab.
* **Horizontal**: Keeps beams horizontally aligned, ignoring the slope and maintaining a consistent height orientation.

For curved floors, only the Horizontal orientation is supported.
