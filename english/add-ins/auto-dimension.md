# Auto Dimension

Auto Dimension is a powerful tool that automatically generates dimension lines for each Grid and Level within Autodesk Revit. This add-in simplifies the process of adding dimensions to your project, enhancing accuracy and saving time.

## Features

* **One-Click Dimensioning:** \
  By clicking the Auto Dimension button, dimension lines are instantly created for all visible Grids and Levels in the current view.&#x20;
* **Customization:** \
  Users can adjust the spacing and select the type of dimension lines according to their project needs.

## Notes

* Dimensions can only be created between parallel grids.&#x20;
* Dimensioning is based solely on Grids and Levels visible in the current view.&#x20;
* The spacing between dimension lines and Grids/Levels excludes the head of lines, focusing solely on the line itself.
