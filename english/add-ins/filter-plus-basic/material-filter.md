# Material Filter

**Material Filter** helps users filter elements based on the materials used in a Revit model. This feature simplifies the process of finding elements that share the same materials, making it easier to work with and manage material-specific tasks.

## **Features**

* **Material-Based Filtering:** \
  Filter elements based on the materials they use, displaying a comprehensive list of materials in the selected search scope.
* **Multiple Selection:** \
  Select multiple materials at once to find all elements that use at least one of the chosen materials.
* **Real-Time Update:** \
  The list of filtered elements updates in real-time as materials are selected or deselected in the panel.

## **Notes**

* Material filtering operates on an OR condition, showing elements that match any of the selected materials.
* Changes in selection only apply after clicking the refresh button to reflect updated element information.
