# Category Filter

**Category Filter** allows users to quickly filter elements based on their category, family, or type. This filter provides an easy way to find specific elements by defining the search scope, displaying results in an organized list format, and allowing for quick selection and management of elements.

## **Features**

* **Search by Category:**\
  Filter elements based on their category, family, or type, allowing quick access to the desired elements within a Revit model.
* **Customizable Search Scope:**\
  Choose between All, Active View, or Selected Elements to define the search range.
* **Result Management:**\
  Group, sort, and search within the result list by dragging column headers or entering keywords. Use the eye icon to focus on specific elements within the active view.

## **Notes**

* Results are updated only when the refresh button is clicked, even if element selection changes outside the view.
* The number of elements selected is displayed in the panel for better tracking.
