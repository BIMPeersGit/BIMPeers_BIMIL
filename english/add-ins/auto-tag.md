# Auto Tag

**Auto Material Tag** streamlines the documentation process in Autodesk Revit by automatically generating material tags for objects composed of multiple layers, such as Basic Walls, floors, ceilings, and roofs. This tool efficiently tags each material layer within an object, displaying both material type and thickness, if desired.

## Features

* **Material Tagging:** \
  Use Auto Tag to select target objects and their placement locations, completing tag creation with just two clicks. The orientation of the texts can be adjusted based on the mouse position.
* **Material and Thickness Visibility Settings:** \
  Customize the display of thickness via Auto Tag Settings. A manual setting option allows for individual specification of thickness display and material name visibility for each material.
* **Tag Updates:** \
  Reflect changes in an object's material layers with the Tag Update feature. Users can apply updates to selected objects, selected families, or the entire project.
* **Manual Tag Updates:** \
  Tags created with manual settings offer the ability to re-specify visibility options individually. The Show button reveals the current appearance and placement of tags.

## Notes

* Tags created with Auto Tag are formatted as Detail Groups, distinct from Revitâ€™s default Material Tags.
* When creating new tags, any existing Detail Groups for tags that have been deleted from the view will be automatically removed.
* Visibility options for manually set tags will reset if changes occur in the host object's materials. A list of reset tags can be accessed by clicking the lower-left corner of the update screen.
* Tags hosted on deleted objects can be bulk deleted when using Tag Update.
