## Font Family

Sets the font family for tag text display. Choose from available system fonts to customize the appearance of your tags.



## Display Thickness

Controls whether thickness values are displayed before material names in material tags.

Options include:

* **On**: Always display thickness values
* **Off**: Never display thickness values
* **Manual**: Individually decide for each tag

The selected option is saved to each tag when created. Once a tag is generated with a specific thickness display setting, it will maintain that setting even after subsequent tag updates.
