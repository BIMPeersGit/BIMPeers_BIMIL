description: Create custom buttons using Dynamo scripts.

# Mynamo

**Mynamo** simplifies running Dynamo scripts compared to the Dynamo Player. With Mynamo, you can easily assign Dynamo scripts to buttons for quick execution.

## Features

* **Custom Button Creation:**\
  Create buttons in the Mynamo group with your desired names and icons. You can also assign shortcuts to these buttons for easy access.
* **Script Execution:**\
  Run scripts without launching Dynamo. Modify nodes specified as inputs and check the output values. If an error occurs during execution, a popup window will display the error details and allow you to save the log.

## Notes

* Scripts execute based on the view that is open at the time the button is pressed.
* The add-in may not function properly if the Dynamo Player is open.
* If Dynamo is open when running a script, the script will open in Dynamo.
* Certain symbols cannot be used in button names.
