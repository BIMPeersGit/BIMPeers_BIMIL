**ArchiFilm** is a smart Revit add-in that turns your 3D model views into high-quality, presentation-ready renderingsâ€”instantly. Without exporting to external software or relying on CG studios, you can now generate compelling visuals directly from your Revit scenes.

## **Features**

* **One-Click Rendering with Custom Prompts**\
  Render any view from your Revit model with just one click. Add prompts to describe desired atmosphere, materials, lighting, or styleâ€”ArchiFilm interprets your input to create visually appealing images without the need for manual setup.
* **Prompt Booster**\
  Unsure how to phrase your prompt? Use the built-in AI-enhancer to refine and optimize your description for better rendering resultsâ€”even if you're new to visual scripting.
* **Multilingual Prompt Support**\
  Write prompts in any language. ArchiFilm uses GPT-based language models to understand and process instructions in all major languages supported by ChatGPT.
* **Preset Management**\
  Save your favorite prompts and rendering settings as **presets**. Easily reuse them across different views or projects to ensure consistency and save time.
* **Upscaling Generated Images**\
  Generated images can be upscaled to high-resolution formatsâ€”ideal for use in presentations, reports, or design deliverables.
* **ArchiFilm Hub**\
  Browse images created by other users. See which prompts and settings were used, and apply them to your own scenes for inspiration or quick testing.

### New Features

* **Image to Prompt**\
  Automatically extract descriptive prompts from an image to jumpstart your rendering process.
* **Image Reference Generation**\
  Guide your renders with reference images to achieve a specific look, mood, or style.
* **Model Reference Rendering**\
  Generate images directly referencing your Revit model for higher fidelity and accurate design output.
* **Basic Mode & Pro Mode**\
  Choose **Basic Mode** for simplified one-click control or **Pro Mode** for advanced customization, giving you flexibility based on your workflow and experience level.

## **Notes**

* Works with any 3D view currently active in Revit.
* Requires internet access for prompt processing and Hub features.
* Output quality depends on view composition and prompt clarity.
