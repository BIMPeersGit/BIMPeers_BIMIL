## **Features**

  Render any view from your Revit model with just one click. Add prompts to describe desired atmosphere, materials, lighting, or style‚ÄîArchiFilm interprets your input to create visually appealing images without the need for manual setup.

  Unsure how to phrase your prompt? Use the built-in AI-enhancer to refine and optimize your description for better rendering results‚Äîeven if you're new to visual scripting.
* **Multilingual Prompt Support**\
  Write prompts in any language. ArchiFilm uses GPT-based language models to understand and process instructions in all major languages supported by ChatGPT.
* **Preset Management**\
  Save your favorite prompts and rendering settings as **presets**. Easily reuse them across different views or projects to ensure consistency and save time.
* **Upscaling Generated Images**\
  Generated images can be upscaled to high-resolution formats‚Äîideal for use in presentations, reports, or design deliverables.
