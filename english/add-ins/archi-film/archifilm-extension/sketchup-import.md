# SketchUp Import

### **Import Process from SketchUp to ArchiFilm Studio**

#### **Overview**

ArchiFilm for SketchUp enables users to send their current camera view directly to ArchiFilm Studio with a single click.\
The extension captures the scene precisely as composed — including camera angle, perspective, and framing — and instantly opens it in the AI rendering workspace.

No exports. No rendering setup. No additional files.
