#### **① Work Timeline**

Each horizontal row is a self-contained **work session** that shows:

* The **prompt used** to generate the result
* Multiple generated images aligned side-by-side
* Direct access to actions such as Edit, Upscale, Delete
* Comparison and selection across variation options

📌 **Purpose:**

* Track design evolution visually across time
* Compare results and choose direction efficiently
* Never lose history or overwrite previous versions

***

#### **② Prompt Caption**

Displayed above each timeline row\
(e.g., _“대규모 박물관 CG 랜더링…”_)

* Shows the exact input prompt used for that batch
* Allows rapid recall and reasoning behind a result
* Enables reuse or continuous refinement

📌 **Purpose:**\
Transparent iteration history for professional design decisions
