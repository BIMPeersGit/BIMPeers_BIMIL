2. **ArchiFilm Hub Shortcut**: Navigates to the ArchiFilm Hub where you can explore images and prompts created by other users.
3. **Presets List**: Shows your saved presets. Click to quickly load settings.
4. **Canvas**: The workspace where your imported 3D view from Revit is initially displayed or where you can click "Import your model".
5. **Settings**: Adjust various options for image generation (Use for, Creativity, Steps, Prompt Strength, Prompt input).
6. **Image Display Area**: The finally generated image or an image selected from the ArchiFilm Hub is displayed prominently here. This area also shows "Generate Image" before an image is loaded or generated.
7. **Gallery Preview**: Small previews of recently generated images are displayed here. You can also find the 'Enhance Prompt' toggle and the 'Generate' button in this lower section.
8. **Top Bar (Credits and Feedback)**: Displays your available credits (e.g., "20") and provides a 'Send Feedback' button. The user's name (e.g., "Hello, BIMPeers") is also shown here.
