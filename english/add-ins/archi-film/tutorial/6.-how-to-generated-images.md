Once an image is successfully generated, you can perform various follow-up actions.

1. **Display Generated Image**: The final result is displayed prominently in the 'Image' area.
2. **Choose Follow-up Actions**:
   * **2.1 Upscale**: Convert the generated image to a higher resolution (e.g., 2x, 4x).
     * Clicking an upscale button (e.g., '2x') will open the "Upscale the image" window. Upon success, a message "The upscaled image has been successfully generated." will appear with an 'OK' button.
   * **2.2 Click 'Save Preset', save as my preset**: Save the settings used for the current image generation as a new preset.
   * **2.3 Click 'Apply', apply my setting value**: (Similar to Tutorial 3) You can immediately apply the current image's settings to another task. (In this image, 'Apply' is visible below 'Save Preset').
   * **2.4 See previous Revit scene**: There is a function to switch to compare with the original Revit view
