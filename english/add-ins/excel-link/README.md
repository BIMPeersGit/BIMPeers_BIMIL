# Excel Link

**Excel Link** facilitates the integration of data from Excel files or clipboard content into Autodesk Revit, transforming them into Legends, Drafting Views, or Schedules. This tool streamlines the process of incorporating spreadsheet data into Revit projects, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of documentation.

## Features

* **Excel File Insertion:** \
  Allows users to upload an Excel file, select specific sheets and ranges, and insert the data as a table. Excel cell and text styles are preserved and applied directly.
* **View Updates:** \
  Updates the inserted Excel data in Revit when the original Excel file is modified, ensuring data consistency across platforms.
* **Clipboard Insertion:** \
  Enables the insertion of values stored in the clipboard as a table in Revit, without the need for direct Excel file insertion.
* **Customizable View Formats:** \
  Users can generate the data in their preferred View Type, choosing from Legend, Drafting View, or Schedule.

## Notes

* Differences in font spacing between Excel and Revit may cause text to extend beyond cell boundaries.
* Changes made by users in the Revit view will not be preserved upon updating the view with new Excel data.
* Cells not specifically aligned in Excel will default to right alignment in Revit.
* Font style is determined based on the first character of the cell.
* Table layout may change when data is inserted from the clipboard.
* When inserting date format data via clipboard, the output format may vary.
* Files with autosave enabled (e.g., in OneDrive) are not supported while open.
