# Auto Dimension

Auto Dimension automatically generates dimension lines between Grids and Levels in the current view with a single click. The dimensioning process depends on whether **Auto** or **Manual** is selected in the [settings](settings-dimensions.md).

## **Auto**

When Auto is selected, dimension lines are instantly created in the direction specified in the [**Direction Settings**](settings-dimensions.md#direction-settings).



## **Manual**

When Manual is selected, a window with 8-direction toggle buttons opens upon executing Auto Dimension.&#x20;

The default direction is set based on the saved **Direction Settings**, but the user can modify it. After selecting the preferred direction, click **OK** to generate the dimensions.
