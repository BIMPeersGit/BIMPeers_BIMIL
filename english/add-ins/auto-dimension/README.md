# Auto Dimension

Auto Dimension is a powerful tool that automatically generates dimension lines for each Grid and Level within Autodesk Revit. This add-in simplifies the process of adding dimensions to your project, enhancing accuracy and saving time.

## **Features**

* **One-Click Dimensioning:** By clicking the Auto Dimension button, dimension lines are instantly created for all visible Grids and Levels in the current view.
* **Customization:** Adjust the spacing, select the type of dimension lines, and specify the placement. In the **Dimension Placement** settings, users can choose between:
  * **Auto:** Automatically generates dimension lines in the direction specified from eight available options.
  * **Manual:** Allows users to select the dimensioning direction through an interactive UI and confirm with an OK to place the dimensions.

## **Notes**

* Dimensions can only be created between parallel grids.
* Dimensioning is based solely on Grids and Levels visible in the current view.
* The spacing between dimension lines and Grids/Levels excludes the head of lines, focusing solely on the line itself.
