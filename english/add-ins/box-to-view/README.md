# 📢 Box to View

## 📌 **What is Box to View?**

**Box to View** Add-in is a Revit extension that automatically generates six orthogonal views **(Front, Back, Left, Right, Top, and Bottom)** from any **Section box or Scope box** you define.

With a single click, it delivers consistent, precisely aligned views for documentation, review, and presentations, eliminating repetitive manual setup.

## ✅ Features

✔️ **6-Direction View Generation**\
–  Front / Back / Left / Right / Top / Bottom\
With _just one click_, you instantly generate views for every direction you need.\
Instead of spending 20–30 minutes setting them up manually, you’ll have them all ready in _under 10 seconds_.

✔️ **View Type & Template Filtering**\
– For each face, select a View Type (Floor Plan, Section, Elevation, Detail) and then pick its View Template.

* **Top** → Floor Plan / Structural Plan / Section
* **Bottom** → Ceiling Plan / Section
* **Front/Back/Left/Right** → Section / Elevation / Detail View

## ⚠️ Notes

* **Template Availability**\
  The Template drop-down only shows templates explicitly defined for the chosen View type—if none appear, check your Revit template library.
* **Compatibility**\
  Requires BIMIL Manager v1.1.7.0 or later.
