# Grid Numbering

**Grid Numbering** helps users automatically rename grids along the same axis using a defined naming convention. Whether working with straight, diagonal, or curved grids, the tool simplifies renaming by applying the same rules across the entire grid system.

## Features

* **Automatic Naming:**\
  Set up prefix, identifier, and suffix to automatically apply names to all grids along the same axis.
* **Preview and Edit:**\
  See the naming results in advance and adjust individual grid names if needed.
* **Directional Sorting:**\
  You can change the numbering order based on directional settings.
* **Applicable to Diagonal and Curved Grids:**\
  The tool recognizes and applies naming rules to both diagonal and curved grids.

## Notes

* The identifier can be up to 6 characters long.
* It can include numbers (1-999999) or letters (a-zzzzzz, A-ZZZZZZ).
* Mixing numbers and letters is not allowed.
