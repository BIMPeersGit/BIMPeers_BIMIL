Easily save, manage, and load section boxes.

## Save Box

Saves the active section box in the current view. By default, the saved name is set to the current date.



## Box History

Displays a list of all saved section boxes created with **Save Box**. You can rename a box by clicking on its name, and delete it by pressing the **X** button. The boxes are automatically sorted in sequential order.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Box History** is saved within the currently open document. If multiple documents are open, the box data from the most recently opened document will be displayed.
{% endhint %}



## Load Box

To load a saved section box, select it from the **Box History** and click **Load Box**. The section box in the current view will update to match the selected box.

{% hint style="info" %}
Section boxes can only be loaded when a 3D view is active.
{% endhint %}
