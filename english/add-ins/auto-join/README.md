# Auto Join

**Auto Join** streamlines the process of managing geometries within Autodesk Revit by enabling users to join or unjoin geometries across different categories according to customized priorities. This tool simplifies complex modeling workflows, making it easier to maintain consistency and integrity in your Revit models.



## Notes

* Objects already joined will be reevaluated and potentially rejoined if they do not meet the established priority criteria.
* It is recommended not to edit the model in Revit while Auto Join or Unjoin operations are in progress to prevent conflicts.
