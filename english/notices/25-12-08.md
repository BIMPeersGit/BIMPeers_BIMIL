## ArchiFilm Studio & BIMIL 2.0 Now Available

We're excited to announce that **ArchiFilm Preview** and **BIMIL 2.0** are now available!

***

### ArchiFilm Preview

ArchiFilm has been rebuilt as a web-based platform. During the preview period, free tokens will be provided so you can try out the features.

#### **ArchiFilm Studio (Web)**

A web-based platform with three core features:

* Generate renders from your images
* Edit specific areas while keeping the rest intact
* Upscale to higher resolutions

Describe what you want to change in plain text, and ArchiFilm handles the rest. Track your full workflow, compare variations, and refine until you're satisfied—all within a single workspace.

#### **ArchiFilm Apps**

* **ArchiFilm** – Revit add-in
* **ArchiFilm (for SketchUp)** – SketchUp extension

These apps import your views and preprocess them into a format the AI can easily interpret, helping preserve building shapes, perspective, and material boundaries more consistently in the final render.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please update to BIMIL 2.0 first before installing these apps.
