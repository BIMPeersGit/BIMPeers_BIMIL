## Coming Monday: Updates for 3 Add-ins and BIMIL v2.0.2.0

Before you wrap up for the week, we wanted to let you know about an update scheduled for this coming **Monday, February 2nd**.

We will be rolling out improvements for three of our add-ins and the BIMIL app itself at **03:00 UTC (12:00 KST)**.

### Add-in Enhancements

We’ve focused on workflow efficiency based on your recent feedback:

* **IDs:** The "Insert ID" tool is now a standalone feature for quicker access. We also added an option to input parameter names directly.
* **Box to View:** Added a new **"Open Generated Views"** option—so you can jump straight into your new view immediately after creation.
* **Mynamo:** Includes UI improvements and bug fixes.

### BIMIL Update (v2.0.2.0)

We are also updating the BIMIL app with the following changes.

* **UI Improvements:** A cleaner look and improved user experience.
* **Settings:** We’ve added a **Credit information** section to help you track your ArchiFilm token usage.
