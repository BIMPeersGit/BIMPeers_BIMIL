## ðŸ”„ Section Box Add-in: 2Dâ†’3D Auto-Open

Weâ€™re happy to announce an update to the **Section Box Add-in** under the **Filter+** section!\
Itâ€™s now smarter, faster, and more convenient.

***

### âœ¨ What's New?

* **Default 3D View Auto-Open**\
  â†’ Even if you are working in a 2D view (such as a floor plan or section),\
  when you run Section Box, BIMIL will automatically open the **Default 3D View** and apply the Section Box.
* **Auto Rotation State Saved**\
  â†’ When you save a Section Box, the Auto Rotation state is now saved together.\
  Even if Auto Rotation is turned off later, you can recall the exact saved view.

* Make sure to **exit BIMIL Manager** from the Windows tray.
* Then, **restart BIMIL Manager** â€” the Add-in list will refresh and the **Update** button will be enabled so you can proceed with the update manually.
