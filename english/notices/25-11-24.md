We’re excited to introduce **Structure Booster**, provided by **SCK**, designed to streamline structural modeling in Revit.

* Import **MGT files from Midas GEN** and automatically generate Revit models

* Use **Excel files exported from Midas Design+** to create structural schedules directly in Revit

### Update Add-in: Auto Join

The upcoming update introduces a new **Check in Detail** option.

Previously, Auto Join only processed elements that physically intersected.

With **Check in Detail** enabled, Auto Join will also join elements that simply **touch,** making it possible to capture edge-to-edge connections that were previously missed.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20; This option may take longer to process due to the more detailed checks.
{% endhint %}

#### BIMIL Update Required

To support these features, **BIMIL 1.3.0.0** has been released.

BIMIL Manager will automatically update the next time you launch it.
