## Fixing install issue on non-admin accounts

We’ve identified an important issue:

In environments where multiple Windows accounts are used on one device — like in many companies — BIMIL Add-in may not appear in Revit if it was installed from an account without administrator rights.

Even though the installation completes in BIMIL Manager,\
the Add-in doesn’t show up in Revit for users without admin access.

We’re very sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused,\
and we’re working quickly to make the Add-in available for everyone, regardless of their Windows account type.

We’ll keep you updated once a fix is ready.
