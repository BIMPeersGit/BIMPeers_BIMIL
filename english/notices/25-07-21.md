## 📌 **What is Excel Sync?**

Excel Sync is a powerful Revit Add-in that allows you to export, edit, and re-import parameter values using Excel or a built-in spreadsheet interface.

No more navigating through dozens of schedules or complex property windows — just fast, flexible control over your BIM data.

Whether you're updating thousands of instance parameters or tweaking type values across multiple families, Excel Sync streamlines the process and reduces human error.
