## **Meet Context Mode in ArchiFilm Studio**

Have you tried ArchiFilm Studio yet? We've just added **Context Mode**, giving you a new way to fine-tune your AI renders.

***

#### Choose Your Generation Style

When generating images in ArchiFilm Studio, you can choose a mode that controls how the AI interprets your image—from creating something new to making subtle adjustments. With the addition of Context Mode, here's a quick guide to each option:

**Generative**\
Uses the basic structure. AI creates a new image freely. \
&#xNAN;_&#x41;vailable only for images imported from Revit or SketchUp._

**✨Context** \
Keeps the structure and prompt meaning. Creates a stable result.

**Refine** \
Makes small changes to the current image.

Not sure which to pick? Start with **Context** for balanced results, or go **Generative** if you want the AI to take the lead.
