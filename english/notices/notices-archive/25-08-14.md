## ✨New Add-in ‘Cleaning Service’ is Coming – August 18✨

We’re excited to announce that our brand-new **Cleaning Service Add-in** will be launching soon!

### 📌 **What is** Cleaning Service?

Cleaning Service is a Revit Add-in from the BIMIL platform that installs and provides t**hree powerful tools in one:**

It allows you to **selectively remove unnecessary elements** from your Revit model, keeping it lightweight, clean, and optimized for maximum performance.

### 💼 Who is it for?

* Need to keep project models in optimal condition
* Avoid conflicts and clutter from unnecessary elements
* Need to deliver clean, optimized models before and after handover

<p align="center">⚠️ Please make sure Revit is closed before updating to avoid any issues⚠️</p>

### 💡 **Why Cleaning Service?**

Revit projects grow, unnecessary elements quietly pile up.\
The result: Heavier models, slower performance, and more time wasted finding what you need.

Cleaning Service solves these hidden problems in just a few clicks:

* Lightens heavy models to improve load and save times
* Removes unused families and incorrect space data to reduce confusion
* Keeps your workspace clean and organized

It’s not just model cleaning — it’s a tool to boost your workflow and productivity.
