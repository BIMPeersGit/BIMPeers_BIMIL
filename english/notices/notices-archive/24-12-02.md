We’re excited to announce that the Shape Cutter add-in is now available in BIMIL!

### New Add-in: Shape Cutter

**Shape Cutter** simplifies the process of creating multiple elements from a single sketch. Draw multiple disconnected profiles in one sketch, and Shape Cutter will separate them into individual elements automatically. It’s an easy way to streamline workflows and manage layouts more efficiently. You can even choose whether to delete the original element or copy its parameters to the new ones.
