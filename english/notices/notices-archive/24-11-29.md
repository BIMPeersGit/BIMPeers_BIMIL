### New Add-in: Shape Cutter

Releasing on **Monday, December 2**, the **Shape Cutter** add-in allows you to separate multiple solids within a single element into distinct elements. It’s perfect for handling complex layouts with greater precision. Customize your workflow by choosing whether to delete the original element or copy its parameters to the new ones.
