✔️ **Grid** – Shows **the name of the grid line** closest to the element’s center point. Supports vertical, horizontal, and diagonal grids.

✔️ **Level** – Shows **the name of the level** the element belongs to, based on its elevation.

✔️ **Room** – Shows information about **the architectural room** containing the element, including the room name and number.

✔️ **Space** – Shows **the logical MEP zone** that groups multiple spaces for system-level organization (e.g., HVAC zones).

✔️ **Zone** – Returns the **logical MEP zone** that groups multiple spaces for system-level organization (e.g., HVAC zones).

✔️ **Area** – Shows **the name or number of the area** containing the element.
