* **Smarter Data Display:**\
  Excel data now adheres to standard alignment rules, automatically adjusting numbers and text for easier readability. Additionally, long text entries are displayed in a single continuous line, making it easier to track information even if it extends beyond the cell boundaries.\

* **Advanced Indentation:**\
  Both custom indentations applied by users and Excel’s default cell padding (ensuring text doesn’t stick directly to cell edges) are now fully supported.\

* **Improved Graphics and Borders:**\
  Borders in Revit schedules now reflect cell states accurately, and dotted borders are now supported for better visual clarity.\

* **Work Seamlessly with Open Files:**\
  You can now use Excel Link with files that are open in Excel.\
  Note: Files with autosave enabled (e.g., in OneDrive) are not supported while open.
