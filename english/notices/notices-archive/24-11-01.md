Weâ€™re excited to share upcoming BIMIL add-in updates and introduce a brand-new add-in release for November. Hereâ€™s what you can expect this month!

### **November 4: Auto Dimension & Beam to Slab Updates**

Next week, updates will be available for two of our most popular add-ins in BIMIL, reflecting your valuable feedback and usage.

* **Beam to Slab** (v1.0.1.1): Enhanced to account for Z-offset in beam positioning and fixed an error that occurred when beams were positioned within sloped slabs.
* **Auto Dimension** (v1.0.1.2): Resolved issues with unit settings to improve overall functionality.

A detailed guide on these updated add-ins will soon be available in BIMIL Docs.

Stay tuned for more details on Filter+ Section Box next week!

#### Auto Join Update&#x20;

Weâ€™ve added advanced settings to Auto Join, allowing users to specify join options for elements within the same category and control structural-non-structural joins. These new options provide more customization for precise joins.
