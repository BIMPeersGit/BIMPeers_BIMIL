A web-based platform with three core features: Generate renders from your images, Edit specific areas while keeping the rest intact, and Upscale to higher resolutions.

#### **ArchiFilm Add-ins**

* **ArchiFilm** – Revit add-in
* **ArchiFilm (for SketchUp)** – SketchUp extension

These apps import your views and preprocess them into a format the AI can easily interpret, helping preserve building shapes, perspective, and material boundaries more consistently in the final render.

Both apps will be available on the new BIMIL 2.0, introduced below.&#x20;
