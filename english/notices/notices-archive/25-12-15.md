## **BIMIL v2.0.1.0 Update Now Available**



After last week's update, some add-ins such as Excel Sync may have experienced errors. We've released a fix to resolve this issue.

### What's New:

* Fixed compatibility issue with some add-ins causing resource loading errors



Please close Revit before updating. Once the update is complete, you can continue using BIMIL add-ins as usual.

Launch BIMIL to update automatically, or if it's already running, right-click the tray icon and select "Check for Updates."
