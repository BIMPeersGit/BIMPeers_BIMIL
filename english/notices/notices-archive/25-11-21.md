The new **Structure Booster** add-in, provided by **SCK**, brings a smoother structural workflow to Revit.

* Import **MGT files from Midas GEN** and automatically generate Revit models

Structure Booster streamlines the process of bringing external structural data into your BIM environment.

For more details, visit the Structure Booster page on [**BIMIL Docs**](../../add-ins/structure-booster/)**.**

### Update Add-in: Auto Join

The upcoming update introduces a new **Check in Detail** option.

Previously, Auto Join only processed elements that physically intersected.

With **Check in Detail** enabled, Auto Join will also join elements that simply **touch,** making it possible to capture edge-to-edge connections that were previously missed.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20; This option may take longer to process due to the more detailed checks.
{% endhint %}

#### BIMIL Update Required

To support these improvements, a new version of BIMIL 1.3.0.0 will also be released.

You’ll receive the update automatically when you launch BIMIL after the release time.
