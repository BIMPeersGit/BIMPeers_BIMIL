## ✨New Add-in ‘Box to View’ is Available!✨

We’re excited to share that **Box to View Add-in is now officially available!**

With Box to View, you can create multiple views in just seconds—no more manual setup.\
It’s the fastest way to keep your project organized and consistent.

***

### 📌 **What is Box to View?**

**Box to View** Add-in is a Revit extension that automatically generates six orthogonal views **(Front, Back, Left, Right, Top, and Bottom)** from any **SectionBox or ScopeBox** you define.

#### ✔️ **6-Direction View Generation** –  Front / Back / Left / Right / Top / Bottom With _just one click_, you instantly generate views for every direction you need. Instead of spending 20–30 minutes setting them up manually, you’ll have them all ready in _under 10 seconds_.

#### ✔️ **View Type & Template Filtering** – For each face, select a View Type (Floor Plan, Section, Elevation, Detail) and then pick its View Template.

* **Top** → Floor Plan / Structural Plan / Section
* **Bottom** → Ceiling Plan / Section
* **Front/Back/Left/Right** → Section / Elevation / Detail View

### 💡 **Why get ready to use this?**

#### “No more wasting time on view setup.”&#xD; “No more errors from project-to-project view settings.”&#xD; “Focus on design, not repetitive tasks.”
