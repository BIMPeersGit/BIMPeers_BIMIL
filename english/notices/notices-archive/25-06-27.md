✔️ **Room** – Provides information about the **architectural room that contains the element**, including room name and number.

✔️ **Space -** Returns the **MEP space** the element is located in. This is typically used in mechanical, electrical, and plumbing design.

✔️ **Zone -** Returns the **logical MEP zone** that groups multiple spaces for system-level organization (e.g., HVAC zones).
