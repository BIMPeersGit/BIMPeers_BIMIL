## What Happens During Installation?

When you click Install, BIMIL Manager:

1. Scans your computer for compatible software versions
2. Downloads the add-in files
3. Installs the add-in to the appropriate directories for each detected version
4. Registers the add-in with the software

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**: If you have Revit 2023, 2024, and 2025 installed, and the add-in supports versions 2022-2026, BIMIL will automatically install it for all three versions on your computer.
{% endhint %}
