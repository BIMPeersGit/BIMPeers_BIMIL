<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/(5) (2).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once an image is successfully generated, you can perform various follow-up actions.

***

### Display Generated Image

* The final result is displayed prominently in the **Image area**.

***

### Choose Follow-up Actions

**2.1 Upscale**

* Convert the generated image to a higher resolution (e.g., _2x, 4x, 4x HQ_).
* Clicking an upscale button opens the **Upscale the image** window.
* Upon success, a confirmation message appears: _“The upscaled image has been successfully generated.”_ with an **OK** button.
* ⚠️ **Note**: _4x HQ_ produces the highest-quality image but **may take significantly longer to generate**, so please use with caution when time is limited.

**2.2 Click “Save Preset”**

* Save the settings used for the current image generation as a new preset.

**2.3 Click “Apply”**

* Apply the current image’s settings (creativity, reference image, prompt, etc.) directly to the **Settings panel** for another task.

**2.4 See Previous Revit Scene**

* Instantly switch to compare the generated result with the original Revit 3D view used for rendering.

**2.5 Auto Save (New in Beta)**

* Generated images can now be **automatically saved** to your computer.
* By default, images are stored in:\
  `Documents\BIMIL\ArchiFilm`
* You can enable/disable Auto Save in the **Detail Option (Beta)** window.
* You can also change the folder path from the **Settings menu**, making it possible to organize images in your preferred location.
