You can check information about credits required for program use and send any issues or improvement ideas to the development team.

### ArchiFilm Alpha Usage Survey Window (When credits are used up)

* If you use all credits provided during the test period, a message will appear:\
  &#xNAN;_“You’ve used all the credits provided during the test period. The Beta version of ArchiFilm is coming soon!”_
* At this point, no additional generations can be performed, and you must wait for the Beta version to become available.
* The survey window may also ask: _“Use it when it’s out?”_ with options to answer **Yes, Maybe, or No**, along with an open text field to share feedback about what you liked or what could be improved.
